        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>3 lb. boneless beef chuck, cut in 1" cubes <br

class="newline" />1 can condensed beef consommé <br 
class="newline" />1/2 cup sherry <br 
class="newline" />2 small onions, thinly sliced <br 
class="newline" />1/2 tsp. curry powder <br 
class="newline" />1/4 tsp. dried basil or 1 tsp. fresh <br

class="newline" />1 stalk celery<br 
class="newline" />6 carrots, scraped and cut on diagonal <br 
class="newline" />Pinch of dried mint or 1 lg. fresh leaf <br 
class="newline" />4 small tomatoes, peeled and cubed <br 
class="newline" />1/2 lb. fresh mushrooms, sliced <br 
class="newline" />2 Tbsp. flour<br 
class="newline" />1 cup tomato puree <br 
class="newline" />1/2 cup ea. finely chopped celery and parsley
<!--l. 2605--><p class="noindent" >Coat beef cubes in flour to coat. Place beef, consommé, sherry, onions, curry powder, basil, clove, bay
leaf, garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper in an oven proof Dutch Oven. Place over moderate heat
and heat until mixture comes to a boil. Add the bacon and celery to top of casserole. Cover and put in
preheated 350<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">° </span>oven. Bake until fork-tender (about 2 hrs.) In the meantime, cook carrots with mint leaf
until tender. (I like to use the microwave for vegetables.) Drain liquid from carrots. When meat is
fork-tender, remove casserole from oven. Discard bacon and celery stalk. Place on range over moderate

heat. Add tomatoes and mushrooms. Mix 2 tbsp. flour with liquid from casserole to make paste;
then add to casserole, stirring until gravy is thickened. Simmer, covered, for 10 min. Add
tomato puree, chopped celery and parsley. Stir and season with additional salt and pepper if
desired. Serves 8 . Buttered noodles are nice with this, and I consider it fancy enough for
company.
<!--l. 2621--><p class="noindent" >Another favorite company dish is Greek Beef Stew. I often do a completely Greek meal
beginning with Dolmas as an appetizer, the stew, a Greek Tossed Salad and Baklava&#8217; for
Dessert.

class="newline" />3 lb. boneless beef chuck, cut into 2" cubes <br 
class="newline" />1 cup Burgundy <br 
class="newline" />1 cup beef broth <br 
class="newline" />1 - 6 oz. can tomato paste<br 
class="newline" />1/4 cup red wine vinegar <br 
class="newline" />2 Tbsp. firmly packed light brown sugar <br 
class="newline" />1 tsp. cumin <br 
class="newline" />1 clove garlic, minced <br 
class="newline" />1/2 tsp. allspice <br 
class="newline" />1 bay leaf <br 
class="newline" />Salt and Pepper <br 
class="newline" />20 small white onions <br 
class="newline" />1/2 lb. fresh mushrooms, trimmed and quartered
<!--l. 2644--><p class="noindent" >Place heavy Dutch Oven over moderate heat and add olive oil. When heated, add the meat
and toss to coat but do not brown. Add the wine, broth, tomato paste, vinegar, sugar and
spices. Bring to a boil Lower heat and simmer, covered for about 1 hour 30 minutes. In a
saucepan, boil water, and blanch onions for one minute. Drain and peel. Add onions to the stew
and simmer another 30 minutes. In a skillet, sauté mushrooms in 3 Tbsp. oil or butter for
about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms to the stew. Remove bay leaf. Test beef for tenderness and
when done, transfer to a heated serving dish. Serves 6 - 8. If I&#8217;m having a large crowd I
serve the Party Pilaf with this. The family likes to sop up the wonderful gravy with French
Bread.

<!--l. 2656--><p class="noindent" >While we&#8217;re in Greece, we may as well add another of Katina Xeros&#8217; recipes. Moussaká is the Greek
dish everyone knows about. It is a bit of work, but is easily prepared ahead and freezes
well.

class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>1 1/2 lb. lean ground beef <br 
class="newline" />2 finely chopped large onions <br 
class="newline" />1/2 tsp. pepper <br 
class="newline" />1 1/2 tsp. salt <br 
class="newline" />2 cups tomato sauce chopped parsley <br 
class="newline" />2 tsp. cinnamon <br 
class="newline" />1/2 tsp. allspice <br 
class="newline" />3 medium eggplant or the equivalent of eggplant and potato <br 
class="newline" />4 eggs <br 
class="newline" />2 cups milk <br 
class="newline" />Approximately 1 lb. grated Romano cheese
<!--l. 2677--><p class="noindent" >Peel and slice eggplant about 1" thick. Soak in a bowl of cold salt water for 15 min. Drain and pat dry
on paper towels. W/pastry brush, brush lightly with olive oil and place on cookie sheet. Broil until
lightly brown on both sides - Drain on paper towels. Place chopped onion in cold skillet. Cover with
ground beef and fry at moderate heat until meat juices are absorbed and onions are tender. Add tomato
sauce and seasonings including parsley. Simmer until thickened. Butter a large baking pan (at least
9x13). Sprinkle bottom with a little grated cheese. Arrange a single layer of eggplant over cheese.
Sprinkle with cheese. Top with a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle with cheese. Continue layers finishing
with layer of eggplant. Combine the 4 beaten eggs with 2 cups milk and a handful of grated cheese.
Pour this mixture over the eggplant and sprinkle with grated cheese and a few dashes of nutmeg.
Pierce the eggplant with a fork in a few places so that the sauce will go down. Bake in a
preheated 375 oven for 20 - 30 min. or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Serves 8
generously.
<!--l. 2694--><p class="noindent" >This dish can also be made using layers of cream sauce made with the Romano cheese. I find that
version a bit rich for our tastes. Pistachio is another Greek dish which basically substitutes cooked,
buttered macaroni for the eggplant. Since J.S. is not an eggplant fan, I have at times made 3/4 of the pan
with eggplant and 1/4 with buttered macaroni. If you want a company dish of Pistachio, double the
amount of ground beef in the recipe above; Toss 1 lb cooked macaroni with 3/4 cup butter and layer
with a rich cream sauce of 8 Tbsp. flour, 4 cups milk, 1/2 cup butter, 4 - 6 egg yolks and the

cheese.
<!--l. 2704--><p class="noindent" >John&#8217;s very favorite Italian dish is Italian Sausage with Peppers. I buy the sausage at Al&#8217;s
Import Groceries at Park Lane and Greenville. It is a very cluttered, funky store, but well
worth the trip. The chef at the Mansion thinks so too as he buys his Italian Sausage from
Al&#8217;s.

class="newline" />3 large sweet peppers, diced ( get 1 ea. of green, yellow and red, if possible)<br 
class="newline" />1 - 8 oz. can tomato puree <br 
class="newline" />1 lemon cut in wedges
<!--l. 2722--><p class="noindent" >Sprinkle a heavy skillet with a thin layer of salt. Heat over high and add the sausage. I leave my piece
whole, but you could cut it into serving sized pieces. Reduce heat to Medium and cook slowly until
sausages are brown. Remove sausages and wipe out skillet. Heat olive oil in cleaned skillet. Add onions
and peppers and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally. When onions are limp and yellow, add puree.
Bring to a simmer. Add sausages and continue to cook until sausages and peppers are done. Serve
over fresh cooked pasta with a squeeze of lemon and a grind of black pepper. Note: If you
can&#8217;t get really good Italian sausage, you may need to add garlic or Italian herbs to this
dish.
<!--l. 2734--><p class="noindent" >When John Stewart was living at home, he would happily eat spaghetti with meat sauce once a week, so
when he left for college, he asked or my recipe. I wrote it out for him, and also gave him a baggie of
oregano from my large supply. Later, I asked him how his first batch had turned out. He said it was a bit
spicy, and when questioned, admitted he had put the whole bag full (about l/2 cup) in one
batch.

<!--l. 2757--><p class="noindent" >Put the chopped onion, green pepper and garlic in a large cold skillet. Break up the ground beef and put
it over the chopped vegetables. Place skillet over moderate heat and cook until the vegetables are limp
and the meat has lost its pink color. Add the tomato paste and the cheese and turn the heat to high.
Cook, stirring and watching until you have scorched the sauce a little. You don&#8217;t want it to be black
-just a nice brown. Now, add the 3 cans of hot water,the seasonings and the wine. Reduce heat and
simmer for about one hour. Serve over fresh cooked pasta with more Parmesan Cheese and pass the
pepper grinder.
<!--l. 2767--><p class="noindent" >I&#8217;m sure you all know how to make lasagna, but I learned a trick from John&#8217;s sister, Rosemary, that
makes it much easier. She makes her cheese sauce with 16 oz. Ricotta (or small curd cottage cheese) 1
egg, 1 cup grated Parmesan, and 1/3 cup fresh chopped parsley. Stir these ingredients together and
layer with cooked noodles, either of the above meat sauces and about a pound of shredded
mozzarella.

have an Armenian family on his mail route named Yesigan. My mother used to make a
batch of this goulash in the summer when the gardens were producing all kinds of good
vegetables. It has never tasted quite as good as it did then but it&#8217;s a nice dish for an informal

<!--l. 2830--><p class="noindent" >Cook the pork bones in the boiling water until the meat begins to fall from the bones. Remove from
heat and cool. Remove any fat and gristle. Pick meat from bones and grind in food processor.
Strain the broth and measure 2 quarts into a heavy kettle. Add the meat and the sage (if
desired) and bring to a rapid boil. Mix the remaining l qt. broth with the corn meal and then
add this mixture to the boiling broth a little at a time. Continue to cook, stirring constantly
until thickened. Reduce heat to lowest setting (you may need to use an asbestos pad) and
continue to cook, stirring often for about 30 min. Taste for seasonings and pour into 2 greased
loaf pans. Cool, then cover with foil and chill overnight. This will keep for 7-10 days in
the refrigerator. When ready to serve, cut in 1/2" slices, dredge in flour and brown over
moderate heat in bacon fat or other drippings. John like applesauce with this, and sometimes an
egg.

and heat until it looks like a thick gravy. Serve over hot pancakes. John turned green when I told him
about this, but he loves it and he is not a liver eater.
<!--l. 2861--><p class="noindent" >We always made our own sauerkraut at home in Pennsylvania and butchered our own hogs. Actually
butchering was a communal chore. All your neighbors would come to help you with your
butchering and then we would help with theirs, etc. Nothing was wasted, hence the 2 previous
recipes. I have all kinds of pork chop and sauerkraut recipes, but I discovered that a Crock

<!--l. 2917--><p class="noindent" >In a large Dutch Oven, heat oil over high heat. Dry chicken thoroughly and brown in hot oil, turning
frequently. When all of chicken is browned, remove to a platter, and add the vegetables. Cook at
medium, stirring frequently until vegetables are limp. Add ham, sausage and seasonings. Continue to
cook, stirring for about 5 min. more. Add browned chicken, rice and water. Turn heat to high and bring
to a boil. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook for about 45 min. stirring occasionally.

During last 10 min., uncover pot and raise heat to medium if rice seems a bit soupy. I&#8217;m
sure the original version of this dish calls for the Cajun sausage, Boudin, which is now
available here in the Metroplex. I just use my favorite smoked sausage which happens to be
Eckrich.

class="newline" />1 small onion, finely chopped <br 
class="newline" />1 cup fine dry bread crumbs <br 
class="newline" />1 1/2 cup mils <br 
class="newline" />1 egg, beaten <br 
class="newline" />1/2 tsp ea. salt and pepper <br 
class="newline" />8 oz blue cheese, cut in 1/2" cubes <br 
class="newline" />6 Tbsp. butter <br 
class="newline" />2 Tbsp. flour <br 
class="newline" />1 cup chicken bouillon <br 
class="newline" />1 cup sour cream
<!--l. 2946--><p class="noindent" >Combine meat, onion, crumbs; blend well. Stir in milk, egg and seasonings; beat until light with
wooden spoon or electric. mixer. With wet hands pat 1/4 cup of meat around each cube of cheese.
Shape into egg-like ovals. Brown slowly in butter. Remove to serving dish and keep warm. Stir the flour
into the drippings and cook until golden. Add the bouillon. Stir and simmer until thick and smooth. Add
sour cream and stir until sauce is heated through but do not boil. Serve meatballs with sauce poured
over. A garnish of fresh parsley or fresh dill is nice. I like just plain boiled potatoes with this and red
cabbage.
