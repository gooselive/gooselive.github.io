<!--l. 2390--><p class="noindent" >I discovered chili rellenos on a little side street in La Jolla when we were living in San Diego. The
restaurant was small, dingy and dark, but I&#8217;ve never been able to duplicate those wonderful
cheese-stuffed chilies. This version is easy and much less messy than the authentic version.

class="newline" />Flour Salt and Pepper <br 
class="newline" />Milk <br 
class="newline" />Oleo or butter

proof-casserole. Preheat oven to 350<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg;</span>. Drain macaroni well. Cover bottom of casserole with macaroni.
Sprinkle cheese over macaroni. Sprinkle on about 1 Tbsp. flour, a little salt and a dash of pepper. Add to
layer 1 Tsp. butter or margarine, cut into 3 small pieces. Repeat, ending with cheese. Pour in milk to
about 2/3 or 3/4 depth of macaroni/cheese mixture. I stop when I can see the milk. Cover and place in
preheated oven. When milk has come to a boil - about 15 - 20 min., Remove cover and continue to bake
until milk is absorbed and casserole has a nice golden crust. My sister and I must have stewed tomatoes
to spoon over each serving and consider this a wholesome meal with the addition of a green
salad.
<!--l. 2459--><p class="noindent" >I keep hearing stories about how prolific zucchini plants are so I have a huge repertoire of zucchini
recipes. However, I seem to excel at growing very large vines and squash blossoms, but have never had
to worry about using up my measly crop. The following is a favorite from the zucchini
file-

        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour<br 
class="newline" />1 tsp. garlic salt <br 
class="newline" />3/4 tsp. baking powder <br 
class="newline" />1/4 tsp. pepper <br 
class="newline" />5 eggs <br 
class="newline" />2/3 cup milk <br 
class="newline" />4-6 zucchini, finely grated (2 cups) <br 
class="newline" />Olive oil <br 
class="newline" />2 cups sour cream or yogurt <br 
class="newline" />2 cups grated Parmesan
<!--l. 2480--><p class="noindent" >Sift flour, salt, baking powder and pepper into a bowl. Beat eggs, add milk and beat until blended. Make
a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid. Blend well and add grated zucchini. On a griddle or
large skillet, heat about 2 Tbsp. olive oil. (I often use l Tbsp. salad oil to 1 Tbsp. olive oil for a less
pronounced flavor.) Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto griddle. Spread into a 6" circle. Fry until golden on
each side, turning once.Use more oil as needed. Keep the cooked crepes warm until all are
prepared.
<!--l. 2489--><p class="noindent" >Fill each crepe with 2 Tbsp. sour cream and 2 Tbsp. grated cheese. Roll up and serve garnished with
parsley. This recipe makes 10 crepes. A wonderful accompaniment is fresh sliced ripe tomatoes9
topped with fresh basil and drizzled with Vinaigrette.
