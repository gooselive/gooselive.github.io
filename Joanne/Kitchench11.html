<!--l. 3344--><p class="noindent" >We eat a lot of poultry at our house. I&#8217;m going to begin with a Thanksgiving Turkey because I think that
is one of the most daunting tasks a new cook faces. I have an easy and foolproof method IF your oven
thermostat is accurate. My oven chose Thanksgiving Eve to go on the blitz on the very year that I had
invited a Chinese friend to her first Thanksgiving Feast. She was very diplomatic. Said she "loved the
gravy .

_____________________________________________________________________
<!--l. 3355--><p class="noindent" >12 lb - 20 lb. turkey, defrosted in original plastic bag in fridge. (24 hr. for ea. 5 lb.) or wrap in several
layers of newspaper; place in paper bag and thaw one hr. per lb at room temperature. The evening
before dinner: wash turkey under cold running water, inside and out. Pull pin feathers. Remove giblets.
Dry thoroughly inside and out. Put giblets in large saucepan; cover with cold water. Add salt and
pepper. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat several hrs. Store overnight in fridge. Salt the turkey
inside. Fill with dressing at both ends (I make a cornbread dressing outside of the turkey. Recipe
follows) Close ends with skewers or by sewing with button thread. Smear the outside of the turkey with
several Tbsp. of margarine. Salt and pepper outside. Tie a heavy string loosely around the bird to hold
wings against body and also anchor the ends of the drumsticks. Put a trivet in the bottom of a large
toasting pan. Place bird on trivet breast side up. 5Over entirely with heavy duty foil, tucking
around the edges of the turkey. I do this after Thanksgiving Eve church services so by the
time the bird is ready for the oven I&#8217;m ready for bed. Set the oven for 275<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg; </span>and cook the
turkey for 30 min. per lb.. If you have a reliable automatic oven, set it to turn off the oven
in the required amount of time. Otherwise, set your alarm. (To be honest, the darned bird
usually smells so good by the time it is cooked that you are awakened by the odor.) Anyway,
you turn off the oven but leave the turkey right there until about an hour before dinner. If
you have only one oven, this does require some planning of where you&#8217;re going to bake
pies, etc.. But remove the turkey from the oven, set oven at 325<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg; </span>and while it is heating,
brush the bird with those lovely drippings in the bottom of the roaster. Put it back in the
oven; check it and baste every 15 min. or until nicely browned. While this is going on, you
are making gravy with those giblets and broth and cooking the cornbread dressing, which
follows.

class="newline" />1 large onion, chopped fine <br 
class="newline" />2/3 cup white port <br 
class="newline" />2 cups sour cream
<!--l. 3419--><p class="noindent" >This was my first "Company" recipe and is still one of my favorites. However, my usual maxim about
enjoying the wine you cook with does not apply here. I can&#8217;t stand the taste of white port except in this
recipe. In a large skillet, melt 4 oz. butter and saut&eacute; the chicken breasts until light brown. Sprinkle with
1 cup wine and cover. Steam for about 20 min. or until tender. In another skillet, melt the 2
oz. butter and saut&eacute; the onion until tender. Add 2/3 cup wine. Stir in the sour cream. Heat

through but do not boil. Season chicken to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken
and serve over rice. (Uncle Ben&#8217;s Long Grain and Wild Rice would be good with this.)
Not quite as fancy but equally as good is the next dish which comes from my dear friend,
Von.

<!--l. 3471--><p class="noindent" >
        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>3 cups boned cooked chicken (or turkey) <br 
class="newline" />2 cups hot milk <br 
class="newline" />1 cup fresh grated coconut (easy with a processor) <br 
class="newline" />2 lg. cloves garlic, minced<br 
class="newline" />2 tsp. ground ginger <br 
class="newline" />5 lg. green onions, chopped fine <br 
class="newline" />2 Tbsp. curry powder * <br 
class="newline" />2 Tbsp. butter, softened <br 
class="newline" />1/3 cup flour <br 
class="newline" />6 Tbsp. butter <br 
class="newline" />1/2 tsp. salt <br 
class="newline" />1/2 cup cream
<!--l. 3473--><p class="noindent" >Pour the hot milk over the coconut and let stand 30 min. Add the garlic, ginger and green onion to the
coconut in the milk. Combine the curry with 2 Tbsp. butter over lowest heat. Stir in the coconut milk
mixture and cook over lowest heat 1 hr. stirring occasionally. * I like the A&amp;P brand. Use a mild
curry. Strain this mixture through a double cheesecloth or a very fine strainer. Set aside.
Blend the flour with 6 Tbsp. butter over very low heat. Add the coconut milk and cook,
stirring constantly until sauce is thickened and smooth. Add salt and cream, stirring to blend.
Add the chicken and cook very slowly for 20 min. Serve over boiled rice with your favorite
accompaniments. My favorites for a "Five Boy" curry (so-called because in India, each accompaniment
would have been presented by a native servant boy) are chopped salted peanuts, grated
coconut, chutney, bacon and preserved violets. For a "Seven Boy", I would add chopped
green onions or French fried onions and hard-boiled eggs with the yolks and whites chopped
separately.
