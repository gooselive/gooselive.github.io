    <p class="noindent">I. Butterfield was "The Perfect Mother" of
    Elmwood Dr.. Not only was she gorgeous with prematurely white
    hair, she was a very talented decorator and a good cook. She

    fat. mix wine with cornstarch. Add to broth and cook, stirring
    constantly until thickened. Add mushrooms and onions with
    liquid. Add drained carrots.* Cook over low heat until
    vegetables are heated through. Serves 4 over buttered rice or
    noodles. * I’m too frugal to buy canned onions or carrots so I
    would cook my own and use the cooking liquid for the bouillon. 
    <!--l. 2578--></p>

    <p class="noindent">When we became affluent enough that I could
    afford a good pot roast instead of the hamburger, I just
    applied the same seasonings to the roast multiplying by the
    pounds the roast weighed. Voilá! Beef Bourgignon.

    1/4 tsp. dried basil or 1 tsp. fresh<br class="newline">

    1/2 cup ea. finely chopped celery and parsley 
    <!--l. 2605--></p>

    <p class="noindent">Coat beef cubes in flour to coat. Place
    beef, consommé, sherry, onions, curry powder, basil, clove, bay
    leaf, garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper in an oven
    proof Dutch Oven. Place over moderate heat and heat until
    mixture comes to a boil. Add the bacon and celery to top of
    casserole. Cover and put in preheated 350<span class=
    "ptmr8c-x-x-109">°</span> oven. Bake until fork-tender (about 2
    hrs.) In the meantime, cook carrots with mint leaf until
    tender. (I like to use the microwave for vegetables.) Drain
    liquid from carrots. When meat is fork-tender, remove casserole
    from oven. Discard bacon and celery stalk. Place on range over
    moderate heat. Add tomatoes and mushrooms. Mix 2 tbsp. flour
    with liquid from casserole to make paste; then add to
    casserole, stirring until gravy is thickened. Simmer, covered,
    for 10 min. Add tomato puree, chopped celery and parsley. Stir
    and season with additional salt and pepper if desired. Serves 8
    . Buttered noodles are nice with this, and I consider it fancy
    enough for company. <!--l. 2621--></p>

    <p class="noindent">Another favorite company dish is Greek Beef
    Stew. I often do a completely Greek meal beginning with Dolmas
    as an appetizer, the stew, a Greek Tossed Salad and Baklava’
    for Dessert. <!--l. 2626--></p>

    20 small white onions<br class="newline">
    1/2 lb. fresh mushrooms, trimmed and quartered 
    <!--l. 2644--></p>

    <p class="noindent">Place heavy Dutch Oven over moderate heat
    and add olive oil. When heated, add the meat and toss to coat
    but do not brown. Add the wine, broth, tomato paste, vinegar,
    sugar and spices. Bring to a boil Lower heat and simmer,
    covered for about 1 hour 30 minutes. In a saucepan, boil water,
    and blanch onions for one minute. Drain and peel. Add onions to
    the stew and simmer another 30 minutes. In a skillet, sauté
    mushrooms in 3 Tbsp. oil or butter for about 3 minutes. Add
    mushrooms to the stew. Remove bay leaf. Test beef for
    tenderness and when done, transfer to a heated serving dish.
    Serves 6 - 8. If I’m having a large crowd I serve the Party
    Pilaf with this. The family likes to sop up the wonderful gravy
    with French Bread. <!--l. 2656--></p>

    <p class="noindent">While we’re in Greece, we may as well add
    another of Katina Xeros’ recipes. Moussaká is the Greek dish
    everyone knows about. It is a bit of work, but is easily
    prepared ahead and freezes well. <!--l. 2662--></p>

    <p class="noindent"></p>

    <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a id=

    <!--l. 2675-->

    <p class="noindent"><span class=

    2 finely chopped large onions<br class="newline">
    1/2 tsp. pepper<br class="newline">
    1 1/2 tsp. salt<br class="newline">
    2 cups tomato sauce chopped parsley<br class="newline">
    2 tsp. cinnamon<br class="newline">
    1/2 tsp. allspice<br class="newline">
    3 medium eggplant or the equivalent of eggplant and
    potato<br class="newline">
    4 eggs<br class="newline">
    2 cups milk<br class="newline">
    Approximately 1 lb. grated Romano cheese <!--l. 2677--></p>

    <p class="noindent">Peel and slice eggplant about 1" thick.
    Soak in a bowl of cold salt water for 15 min. Drain and pat dry
    on paper towels. W/pastry brush, brush lightly with olive oil
    and place on cookie sheet. Broil until lightly brown on both
    sides - Drain on paper towels. Place chopped onion in cold
    skillet. Cover with ground beef and fry at moderate heat until
    meat juices are absorbed and onions are tender. Add tomato
    sauce and seasonings including parsley. Simmer until thickened.
    Butter a large baking pan (at least 9x13). Sprinkle bottom with
    a little grated cheese. Arrange a single layer of eggplant over
    cheese. Sprinkle with cheese. Top with a layer of meat sauce.
    Sprinkle with cheese. Continue layers finishing with layer of
    eggplant. Combine the 4 beaten eggs with 2 cups milk and a
    handful of grated cheese. Pour this mixture over the eggplant
    and sprinkle with grated cheese and a few dashes of nutmeg.
    Pierce the eggplant with a fork in a few places so that the
    sauce will go down. Bake in a preheated 375 oven for 20 - 30
    min. or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Serves
    8 generously. <!--l. 2694--></p>

    <p class="noindent">This dish can also be made using layers of
    cream sauce made with the Romano cheese. I find that version a
    bit rich for our tastes. Pistachio is another Greek dish which
    basically substitutes cooked, buttered macaroni for the
    eggplant. Since J.S. is not an eggplant fan, I have at times
    made 3/4 of the pan with eggplant and 1/4 with buttered
    macaroni. If you want a company dish of Pistachio, double the
    amount of ground beef in the recipe above; Toss 1 lb cooked
    macaroni with 3/4 cup butter and layer with a rich cream sauce
    of 8 Tbsp. flour, 4 cups milk, 1/2 cup butter, 4 - 6 egg yolks
    and the cheese. <!--l. 2704--></p>

    <p class="noindent">John’s very favorite Italian dish is
    Italian Sausage with Peppers. I buy the sausage at Al’s Import
    Groceries at Park Lane and Greenville. It is a very cluttered,
    funky store, but well worth the trip. The chef at the Mansion
    thinks so too as he buys his Italian Sausage from Al’s.

    1 lemon cut in wedges <!--l. 2722--></p>

    <p class="noindent">Sprinkle a heavy skillet with a thin layer
    of salt. Heat over high and add the sausage. I leave my piece
    whole, but you could cut it into serving sized pieces. Reduce
    heat to Medium and cook slowly until sausages are brown. Remove
    sausages and wipe out skillet. Heat olive oil in cleaned
    skillet. Add onions and peppers and cook over low heat,
    stirring occasionally. When onions are limp and yellow, add
    puree. Bring to a simmer. Add sausages and continue to cook
    until sausages and peppers are done. Serve over fresh cooked
    pasta with a squeeze of lemon and a grind of black pepper.
    Note: If you can’t get really good Italian sausage, you may
    need to add garlic or Italian herbs to this dish.

    <p class="noindent">When John Stewart was living at home, he
    would happily eat spaghetti with meat sauce once a week, so
    when he left for college, he asked or my recipe. I wrote it out
    for him, and also gave him a baggie of oregano from my large
    supply. Later, I asked him how his first batch had turned out.
    He said it was a bit spicy, and when questioned, admitted he
    had put the whole bag full (about l/2 cup) in one batch.

    turn the heat to high. Cook, stirring and watching until you
    have scorched the sauce a little. You don’t want it to be black
    -just a nice brown. Now, add the 3 cans of hot water,the
    seasonings and the wine. Reduce heat and simmer for about one
    hour. Serve over fresh cooked pasta with more Parmesan Cheese
    and pass the pepper grinder. <!--l. 2767--></p>

    <p class="noindent">I’m sure you all know how to make lasagna,
    but I learned a trick from John’s sister, Rosemary, that makes
    it much easier. She makes her cheese sauce with 16 oz. Ricotta
    (or small curd cottage cheese) 1 egg, 1 cup grated Parmesan,
    and 1/3 cup fresh chopped parsley. Stir these ingredients
    together and layer with cooked noodles, either of the above

    <p class="noindent">Cook the pork bones in the boiling water
    until the meat begins to fall from the bones. Remove from heat
    and cool. Remove any fat and gristle. Pick meat from bones and
    grind in food processor. Strain the broth and measure 2 quarts
    into a heavy kettle. Add the meat and the sage (if desired) and
    bring to a rapid boil. Mix the remaining l qt. broth with the
    corn meal and then add this mixture to the boiling broth a
    little at a time. Continue to cook, stirring constantly until
    thickened. Reduce heat to lowest setting (you may need to use
    an asbestos pad) and continue to cook, stirring often for about
    30 min. Taste for seasonings and pour into 2 greased loaf pans.
    Cool, then cover with foil and chill overnight. This will keep
    for 7-10 days in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, cut in
    1/2" slices, dredge in flour and brown over moderate heat in
    bacon fat or other drippings. John like applesauce with this,
    and sometimes an egg. <!--l. 2846--></p>

    return to the broth. Season and pour into a refrigerator
    container. Mina always used bread pans because she had lots of
    them. To serve, place 1 1/2 cup of the liverwurst in a saucepan
    over low heat and heat until it looks like a thick gravy. Serve
    over hot pancakes. John turned green when I told him about
    this, but he loves it and he is not a liver eater.

    <p class="noindent">We always made our own sauerkraut at home
    in Pennsylvania and butchered our own hogs. Actually butchering
    was a communal chore. All your neighbors would come to help you
    with your butchering and then we would help with theirs, etc.
    Nothing was wasted, hence the 2 previous recipes. I have all
    kinds of pork chop and sauerkraut recipes, but I discovered
    that a Crock Pot is easy and really the best way for those
    chops that are not good enough for gourmet treatment.

    <p class="noindent">In bottom of Crock pot place 4 medium,

    pork chops, 1 - 16 oz can sauerkraut, salt and pepper to taste
    and 1 Tbsp. caraway seeds. Cook at Low 6 to 8 hrs. or until
    chops are tender. Now, wasn’t that easy? If you want to go
    gourmet, my Winekraut recipe is under Vegetables.

    <p class="noindent">1 3-4 lb. boneless pork loin<br class=

    Rub loin with salt, pepper, sage, and nutmeg. Brown on top of

    2 cups red wine <!--l. 2888--></p>

    <p class="noindent">Bake at 350<span class=

    done, add 1 cup canned beef consommé and bake 20 min. more.
    Slice and serve with the wonderful pan drippings. Ms. Corbett
    suggests glazed onions and oven browned potatoes with this, but
    I sort of like rice because it soaks up the gravy so well.

    <p class="noindent">In a large Dutch Oven, heat oil over high
    heat. Dry chicken thoroughly and brown in hot oil, turning
    frequently. When all of chicken is browned, remove to a
    platter, and add the vegetables. Cook at medium, stirring
    frequently until vegetables are limp. Add ham, sausage and
    seasonings. Continue to cook, stirring for about 5 min. more.
    Add browned chicken, rice and water. Turn heat to high and
    bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook for
    about 45 min. stirring occasionally. During last 10 min.,
    uncover pot and raise heat to medium if rice seems a bit soupy.
    I’m sure the original version of this dish calls for the Cajun
    sausage, Boudin, which is now available here in the Metroplex.
    I just use my favorite smoked sausage which happens to be
    Eckrich. <!--l. 2931--></p>

    Serve meatballs with sauce poured over. A garnish of fresh
