<!--l. 876--><p class="noindent" >Pick over and rinse 1 lb. Great Northern beans. Place in large soup pot and cover with cold water. Place
over high heat and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp. baking soda and boil for 60-90 seconds. Drain and rinse
well. Return to pot and cover well with water (at least 8 cups). Add 1 meaty ham bone.
Bring to boiling, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 2 - 4 hrs. until beans are tender. Add 1
large chopped onion, 1 bay leaf and 1/2 tsp.pepper. Taste for salt. If too salty, add 1 pared
diced potato. (This will aid any soup which is too salty.) Cook 1 hr. more or until beans
are very tender. Remove bay leaf and ham bone. Cut meat from bone, return to pot and
serve.
<!--l. 887--><p class="noindent" >Note: The preboiling with baking soda is supposed to relieve the gassy aftereffects of eating
beans. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t, but I recommend it for all my soup
recipes.
<!--l. 891--><p class="noindent" >When John was in the Air Force, he was stationed at McDill Field in Tampa, Fla. After we were
married, he took me there for a visit and we ate at a wonderful Cuban restaurant called Las Novedades.
This is one of my favorites from there

___________________________________________________________
<!--l. 988--><p class="noindent" >This soup was served at the First Epiphany Bazaar and has been a family favorite ever since. It is much
easier if you have a food processor. Just chop and shred and slice in the order given in the recipe You
don&#8217;t even have to wash the processor between ingredients.

<!--l. 1015--><p class="noindent" >We picked up our Cioppino recipe while living in San Diego, California. One of the stories told about

class="newline" />1 lb. raw shrimp <br 
class="newline" />1 large crab (optional) <br

class="newline" />1 1/2 cups onion, chopped <br 
class="newline" />1 cup green pepper, chopped <br

class="newline" />1/4 tsp. basil, crumbled
<!--l. 1044--><p class="noindent" >Cut the fish into serving sized pieces. Shell shrimp and devein. Clean and crack the crab saving all large
pieces of shell with meat in them. Scrub clams. Cook the onion and garlic and green pepper in hot oil.
Add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, wine and parsley. Add the seasonings. Cook for 30 min. Arrange
the fish, crab and shrimp in layers in a large Dutch Oven. Pour the sauce over the seafood
and cook over low heat until the fish is tender, about 30 min. Watch closely as less firm
fish will cook more quickly. Add the clams and when they open, sprinkle with additional
parsley and serve. If you are lucky enough to have seafood in the shell, you may want to
offer bibs with this dish. If you add a tossed salad and French bread you have a fabulous
meal.
