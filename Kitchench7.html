<!--l. 1981--><p class="noindent" >Seafood is really a "Fast Food" in that it takes a very short time to cook. The biggest crime that
restaurants perpetrate is overcooking fish. Many of the following recipes can be prepared in
minutes and even those that require some advance preparations, can be finished in less than 15
minutes.

glaze to the sauce.
<!--l. 2057--><p class="noindent" >Do you notice that I do not say how many these recipes serve? I buy 2/3 to 3/4 lb. of boneless fish
for just the two of us. Our family has notorious appetites so I don&#8217;t really know what is
average. Besides, with today&#8217;s microwaves it is so easy to warm up leftovers that I always cook
plenty.

        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>8 - 10 oz. redfish or red snapper fillets <br 
class="newline" />2 cups butter, melted<br 
class="newline" />1/4 cup fresh lemon juice<br 
class="newline" />1 Tbsp. dried thyme, crumbled<br 
class="newline" />2 tsp. freshly ground pepper <br 
class="newline" />1 1/2 tsp. ground red pepper <br 
class="newline" />1 tsp. salt.
<!--l. 2075--><p class="noindent" >Fillets should be skinned. Check over for bones. (This is a given for all fish fillets) Return fillets to
refrigerator until ready to fry. Melt butter in a heavy skillet over low heat. Stir in seasonings and lemon
juice. Cook 10 min. Pour into shallow dish. Over high heat, heat a large cast iron skillet until bottom
begins to form white haze. Pat fish dry. Dip each fillet into butter mixture. Place in dry skillet. Turn and
cook other side. We&#8217;re talking immediately here. I would say 15 seconds per side. The fish will

turn black and the smoke will be rolling. Remove from skillet. Repeat with remaining fish.
Cover loosely and keep warm. Add the remaining butter mixture to skillet over high heat
and stir with spoon or spatula, scraping up the browned bits. When butter has turned dark
brown, spoon over fish and serve immediately. Now, because of the size of the fillets and all
that butter, I would guess that this should serve 8 deliciously with a green salad and crusty
bread.

<!--l. 2105--><p class="noindent" >Boil shrimp and crawfish in shells until done. (Med. shrimp take 5 min. at most) Cool and shell. Chop
very fine. Chop onions very fine. Sauté onions in butter until limp and yellow. Add shrimp and
crawfish, Add flour. Stir until smooth. Then add milk, and egg yolks, stirring constantly with wooden
spoon to make a very heavy white sauce. Season with salt and nutmeg. Cool. Now cut Pompano in half,
skin and fillet. (You know me - I&#8217;d buy four nice fillets of 4 oz. each) Now, you need four
sheets of vegetable parchment paper, but you can use brown grocery bags. On each piece
of paper, place 3 Tbsp. of the heavy sauce and top with a fillet. Pour over a little melted
butter and fold, sealing as you would for the freezer by folding over at the top. Place the 4
pkg. in a well-buttered baking pan and bake in a hot oven for 15 min. Serve hot in paper
packages. As you can see, this takes a bit of time, but can be prepared ahead up until the time of
baking.

<!--l. 2132--><p class="noindent" >Peel shrimp. Wipe mushrooms with a damp paper towel and slice. Halve garlic clove. Melt butter in a
large skillet. Add garlic and allow to set so that butter absorbs garlic flavor. (If you don&#8217;t have time for
this, stick a toothpick in each garlic half for easy retrieval later). When all your guests are present and
the salad, etc. are ready, reheat the butter. Sauté the shrimp about 7 min, turning and stirring so that they
cook evenly. Add mushrooms and sauté with shrimp until mushrooms are cooked. Add rice to skillet.
At this time you may want to add more butter. When rice is heated through, serve to 4 garnished with
a sprig of parsley. A green salad, crisp bread, a good white wine and your reputation is
made.

fact, I get a little paranoid if there&#8217;s no tuna in the house. I thinks it dates back to the days when I was in
the hospital with polio being fed through various tubes. My only entertainment was Arthur Godfrey&#8217;s
Radio Show. Two of his sponsors were Star Kist Tuna and Peter Pan Peanut Butter. I lay
there listening to those highly descriptive commercials and then at the end of the show, they
passed out sandwiches to the radio audience. I vowed that if and when I could eat again, I
would never be without tuna fish and peanut butter. So here are a few of my favorite tuna
recipes.

the house. I don&#8217;t recommend the cooking wines sold in the supermarket. You might as well enjoy a
little wine while you&#8217;re cooking, so invest in a good dry vermouth, a good dry sherry and a big jug of
Gallo Hearty Burgundy. You&#8217;ll be prepared for any occasion.
